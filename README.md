This is IanOS! A bare metal raspberry pi "OS" for the RPi3! This repo was made possible by the amazing bztsrc. (https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial) The uart, gpio, delay, power, mailbox were taken from the guide and given slight personal modifications to suit my project. Thanks to bztsrc's guide I was able to learn a ton about working directly with hardware and creating a working system. My project is currently fully working on a Raspberry Pi 3 B. It uses UART0 to serialize IO on the Pi's GPIO pins. Upon booting you are presented with an interactive shell that can test and showcase features of the Pi3. This project is always improving and is totally open source.
